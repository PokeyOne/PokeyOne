# Mateo Carreras

Currently a Canadian Ruby on Rails web developer and third-year computer engineering student, with an interest in low-level/embedded systems, communication systems, and web architecture. Also enjoy learning about languages and music.

First language is English, but know some spanish from family, and have been learning Scottish Gaelic in my free time for a while.

## Project Highlights

These are just some projects that I have public on GitHub. Right now they all
happen to be in Rust, but I have also worked extensively with Ruby, Rails, Java,
C, Python, and worked on a few embedded systems projects in C, Assembly, and VHDL.

- [Yet Another Pokey Render Engine](https://github.com/PokeyOne/yapre) - Ray-casting rendering engine built in Rust.
- [Pokey Logger](https://github.com/PokeyOne/pokey-logger) - Logging library built in Rust.
- [Clasp](https://github.com/PokeyOne/clasp) - Programming language built in Rust.
